The Apache Commons FileUpload team is pleased to announce the commons-fileupload2-2.0.0-M4-SNAPSHOT release!

The Apache Commons FileUpload component provides a simple yet flexible means of adding support for multipart
    file upload functionality to servlets and web applications.

Changes in this version include:

New features:
o Add partHeaderSizeMax, a new limit that sets a maximum number of bytes for each individual multipart header. The default is 512 bytes. Thanks to Mark Thomas. 

Fixed Bugs:
o Simplify exception handling in FileItem API #309. Thanks to Basil Crow. 



Have fun!
